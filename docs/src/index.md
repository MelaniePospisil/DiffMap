# diffmap.jl Documentation

Diffusion Maps is a Julia package for dimension reduction using the Diffusion Maps algorithm. It provides a simple and efficient way to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data while preserving the underlying structure. It is built on the MultivariateStats interface, providing the necessary functions such as fit, projection, predict, and reconstruct.

This module is part of a bachelor's thesis at the Technical University of Munich.
